# Stratum Flutter UI

Every screen and component in an app that depends on `stratum_ui` builds on this layout family. Each primitive styles
its own box (`style: WidgetStyle`), takes one interaction (`interaction: StratumInteraction`) for taps, hover, and
shortcuts, and scrolls through one `scroll: StratumScroll` model — never a raw `Container`, `Column`, `Row`, or
`ListView`. Import the barrel: `package:stratum_ui/src/src.dart`.

## Box layouts

Each entry: usage, key parameters, keyboard behavior.

- **`ContainerLayout`** — a styled box around one `child`.
  Key parameters: `style`, `child`, `fit` (a `BoxFit` that scales `child` into the padded area through a
  `FittedBox`; asserts `fit == null || scroll == null`, because a scrolling box has no extent to fit into).
  Keyboard: none of its own; a tap surface comes from `interaction`.
- **`FlexLayout`** — the base of `ColumnLayout` and `RowLayout`: a `Flex` whose `direction` may change between
  builds without remounting children, with `mainAxisAlignment`, `crossAxisAlignment`, `gap` (maps to `Flex.spacing`),
  and `crossAxisIntrinsic` (sizes the cross axis to the largest child, unless `style` sets that cross size; a
  `direction` change keeps the children's `State` with it set too, and only toggling it remounts them).
  Keyboard: `focusGroup` turns its children into one roving Tab stop (K3): arrows by screen direction, Home, End.
- **`ColumnLayout`**, **`RowLayout`** — `FlexLayout` with `direction` fixed to vertical or horizontal; same
  parameters, defaults, and order as before `FlexLayout` existed, so no caller changes.
  Keyboard: same `focusGroup` roving group as `FlexLayout`.
- **`StackLayout`** — a `Stack` for overlapping and `Positioned` children, with `alignment`, `fit`, and
  `clipBehavior` acting on the stack (`style.alignment`/`style.clipBehavior` act on the box instead).
  Keyboard: none; every child keeps its own focus.
- **`IndexedStackLayout`** — shows one child at `index` (null shows none) and mutes hidden children's tickers through
  `TickerMode`, so paused animations resume on return. Key parameters: `index`, `alignment`, `sizing`, `clipBehavior`.
  Keyboard: when `index` changes while focus sits in the outgoing child, focus moves after the frame to the first
  Tab-order node of the incoming child, else to the stack's own (non-Tab-stop) node.
- **`WrapLayout`** — a `Wrap` that lays children in runs across `direction`, with `gap`, `runGap`, and `focusGroup`.
  Keyboard: `focusGroup` roving group (K3), same as `FlexLayout`.

## Scroll views

All six share one keyboard model (K4) through the internal `ScrollViewBox`: a `focusable` view (true by default on
web, macOS, Windows, and Linux) is one Tab stop whose arrows (50 px), Page Up/Page Down (0.8 viewport), Home, and End
scroll it, guarded so a text field inside keeps its own keys.

- **`ListViewLayout`**, **`GridViewLayout`**, **`CustomScrollViewLayout`** — lazy list, grid, and sliver view inside
  a `WidgetStyle` box; `style.padding` becomes the scroll padding, so it scrolls with the content.
  Keyboard: K4 line-mode scrolling, each key over the theme's `fast` level (125 ms in the package default) on its
  `standard` curve, or a jump when `MediaQuery` or the platform asks for reduced motion.
- **`PageViewLayout`** (children or `.builder`) — one page per viewport, with `scrollDirection`, `controller`,
  `pageSnapping`, `onPageChanged`; `style.padding` insets the viewport rather than scrolling.
  Keyboard: an arrow along the axis, Page Up/Page Down, Home, and End move one whole page; a change slides over the
  theme's `slow` level (300 ms in the package default) on its `standard` curve, or jumps when `MediaQuery` or the
  platform asks for reduced motion or the level has no duration; focus moves to the new page's first Tab-order node.
  Buttons: the layout draws no previous or next buttons, and on desktop a mouse without a trackpad cannot swipe, so
  the app adds previous and next buttons around the view (WCAG 2.5.1) until a component in the package provides
  them. Like the keys, the buttons jump when motion is reduced or the theme's `slow` level has no duration, else
  `previousPage` or `nextPage` over that level's duration and curve.

  ```dart
  void turn(BuildContext context, {required bool forward}) {
    final slow = StratumTheme.of(context).animation.slow;
    final reduced =
        MediaQuery.disableAnimationsOf(context) ||
        View.of(context).platformDispatcher.accessibilityFeatures.reduceMotion ||
        slow.duration == null ||
        slow.duration == Duration.zero;
    if (reduced) {
      final page = (pages.page ?? 0).round() + (forward ? 1 : -1);
      pages.jumpToPage(page.clamp(0, slides.length - 1));
    } else if (forward) {
      pages.nextPage(duration: slow.duration!, curve: slow.curve ?? Curves.easeInOutSine);
    } else {
      pages.previousPage(
        duration: slow.duration!,
        curve: slow.curve ?? Curves.easeInOutSine,
      );
    }
  }

  ColumnLayout(
    children: [
      Expanded(child: PageViewLayout(controller: pages, children: slides)),
      RowLayout(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
        children: [
          ContainerLayout(
            semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Previous slide'),
            interaction: StratumInteraction(
              onTap: () => turn(context, forward: false),
            ),
            child: const Icon(Icons.chevron_left),
          ),
          ContainerLayout(
            semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Next slide'),
            interaction: StratumInteraction(
              onTap: () => turn(context, forward: true),
            ),
            child: const Icon(Icons.chevron_right),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  )
  ```
- **`ReorderableListViewLayout`** (`.builder` only) — a reorderable list on widgets `ReorderableList`, with a
  caller-placed drag handle or `longPressDrag`, `onReorderItem`, and `dragStyle` for the lifted item; each item keeps
  its `State` and focus across a move through a global key that never uses the index.
  Keyboard: Alt+arrow along the axis moves the focused item one slot, Alt+Home/Alt+End move it to either end; a move
  past either end is still handled, so it never reaches the browser (Chrome's Alt+Left/Alt+Right Back/Forward).
  Without dragging: dragging is the list's only pointer path, so the app adds one that needs no drag (WCAG 2.5.7),
  such as Move up and Move down buttons or context-menu entries on each item, until a component in the package
  provides it. They call the handler the app passes to `onReorderItem`, with the indexes the keys pass, and that
  handler ignores a target past either end.

  ```dart
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => RowLayout(
    key: ValueKey(tasks[index].id),
    children: [
      Expanded(child: Text(tasks[index].title)),
      ContainerLayout(
        semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Move up'),
        interaction: StratumInteraction(onTap: () => moveTask(index, index - 1)),
        child: const Icon(Icons.arrow_upward),
      ),
      ContainerLayout(
        semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Move down'),
        interaction: StratumInteraction(onTap: () => moveTask(index, index + 1)),
        child: const Icon(Icons.arrow_downward),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  ```

  Insert and remove: pass a `StratumReorderableItemsController` as `itemsController` (the scroll `controller` stays
  separate) and call `insertItem(index)` or `removeItem(index)` in the same turn as the data change, outside a build
  and outside `onReorderItem`, `onReorderStart`, and `onReorderEnd`; from those, call after the frame.
  An added item grows and fades in over the theme's `normal` level, and a removed one shrinks and fades out in the
  look it had, unless `removeItem`'s `builder` gives it another; `itemTransitionBuilder(context, animation, child)`
  replaces the size and fade both ways. Without `builder`, a removed item's leaving copy ends at once if its key
  comes back; pass `builder` to keep that copy fading on its own look instead. The leaving item keeps its State and
  still rebuilds, so an item that reads its data through `context` (a `watch` or `select` by id or index, a provider
  family) needs a `builder` that captures that data. Under reduced motion, or with `itemExtent`, `itemExtentBuilder`,
  or `prototypeItem`, the size jumps and the fade plays. Focus on a removed item moves to the next item, else the
  previous one, else the list's own Tab stop when the list is focusable, unless the app moves focus itself in the
  same turn; a focused item the app removes and inserts back with its key in the same turn keeps focus instead, and
  the list scrolls to it and shows it. A reorder of a leaving item's neighbor ends that leaving item. An insert or
  remove during a drag, or an item-count change, ends the drag first with `onReorderEnd` at its start index and no
  `onReorderItem`.

  ```dart
  final itemsController = StratumReorderableItemsController();

  void addTask(int index, Task task) {
    setState(() => tasks.insert(index, task));
    itemsController.insertItem(index);
  }

  void deleteTask(int index) {
    setState(() => tasks.removeAt(index));
    itemsController.removeItem(index);
  }
  ```

  Move: call `moveItem(from, to)` in the same turn as moving the item in the data, where `to` is the index the item
  ends at, as `onReorderItem` reports it. The old slot closes while the item grows and fades into its new one over the
  theme's `normal` level (under reduced motion or a fixed extent the slot closes at once and the item only fades in);
  the item keeps its State and focus, a focused item shows on screen even when its new slot is far off screen, and
  `onReorderItem` does not fire. Prefer it to `removeItem` plus `insertItem`, which keeps the item's State only when
  the list has built its new slot. The Move up and Move down buttons above can call it.

  ```dart
  void moveTask(int from, int to) {
    if (to < 0 || to >= tasks.length) return;
    setState(() => tasks.insert(to, tasks.removeAt(from)));
    itemsController.moveItem(from, to);
  }
  ```
- **`NestedScrollViewLayout`** — a collapsing header (`headerSliverBuilder`) above a `body` scroll view; it is never
  a Tab stop itself, only the body's scroll view is, and a desktop scrollbar needs `showScrollbar: false` when the
  body is a `TabBarView`.
  Keyboard: the body's K4 keys act on one joined range, header extent then list extent — a key that would collapse
  past the header's end spills the remainder into the list, and Home/End expand or fully collapse the header.

## Spacing

- **`Space`** — static getters/constructors for fixed spacers and insets (`Space.box16`, `Space.empty`, and the
  rest), returning `SizedBox`, `Gap`, or `EdgeInsets` in steps from 1 to 72 px.
- **`SpaceDirectional`** — the same steps as `EdgeInsetsDirectional`, so start and end mirror under
  `TextDirection.rtl`.

## Themes

- **Theme font files** — a theme ships its own fonts by listing them under `typography.fonts.<key>.files` in its
  `theme.yaml`: paths relative to that file's folder, ending in `ttf` or `otf` (`files: [fonts/Brand-Regular.ttf]`).
  Declare the font folder in pubspec (`- assets/themes/brand/fonts/`), since Flutter does not include asset
  subfolders. A font with `files` takes no `package` and no `Google/` family. Each theme's fonts register under
  `<theme id>/<family>`, so two themes may ship files under the same family name; a theme that inherits the font
  from a layer it merges over shares that layer's registration.
- **Default theme fonts** — the package default theme names Google fonts only (`Google/Inter`, `Google/Geist`,
  `Google/Geist Mono`, `Google/Roboto Mono`, `Google/Kanit`) and bundles no font file. The app owns
  `GoogleFonts.config`: bundle the font files under its own assets to skip the download, which also keeps the app's
  widget tests off the network, since the google_fonts library looks in the assets first.
- **Google font weights** — a Google font draws only in the weights its theme loads it in: each type's `weight` for
  the font that type names, and every type's weight for each tag's `body` font and theme-wide `mono`. A recipe weight
  outside that set, such as `.medium` on the package default's Inter (loaded in 400 and 600), draws the nearest loaded
  weight, the heavier on a tie, and prints one debug warning per family and weight. A Google font in the fallback list
  snaps the style's drawn weight — the primary's snapped weight, or the recipe's weight when the primary is an app or
  theme font — into its own set: the drawn weight when its set holds it, otherwise the nearest weight in it (the
  heavier on a tie), which can be lighter than the primary. The package asks google_fonts for
  no other weight, with run-time fetching on or off, so bundling exactly those weights keeps every normal-style Google
  font off the network; an italic face loads on first use, at the snapped weight. A font the theme ships as `files`
  or the app registers keeps the weight it is asked for.
- **Material text theme** — `StratumThemeApplication` inserts a Material `ThemeData` whose text theme resolves Stratum
  recipes for the active theme, locale, and window size: display and headline slots read `header`; title, body, and
  label slots read `body`. No slot sets a weight, so each draws its type's yaml weight: title and label slots draw the
  body weight (400 in the package default), not Material's medium.
- **Theme models** — the parsed theme types (`StratumThemeConfig`, `StratumColorSets`, `StratumTypography`,
  `StratumTypeStyle`, `StratumAnimationConfig`, and the models inside them) are immutable values with `copyWith`;
  their maps refuse changes, so derive a variant with `config.copyWith(name: ...)` instead of editing a map. A
  `StratumCurve` gives its Flutter `Curve` as `.curve` through `package:stratum_ui/stratum_ui.dart`.
- **Before `preload`** — call `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` first: `preload` reads the asset manifest
  through `rootBundle`, which needs the binding. In a `testWidgets` test, the background parse runs on a real
  isolate, which the test's fake-async zone never finishes; run `preload`, or pump a tree rooted in
  `StratumThemePreloader`, under `tester.runAsync`.
- **`StratumThemeController`** — the registered themes and the active one. Build it before the first themed frame
  with `await StratumThemeController.preload(initialThemeId: savedId, onThemeChanged: save)`; `googleFontsTimeout`
  (default 3 s, also the limit of every switch) and `bundle` are optional. It registers every
  `assets/themes/<id>/theme.yaml` the app declares in pubspec as `<id>` (`themeIds`: `default` first, then
  alphabetical), and an app `default` folder layers over the package default. An `initialThemeId` that names no
  theme starts on `default` and calls `onThemeChanged('default')`, so the app overwrites its saved id; a theme file
  with problems throws `StratumThemeFormatException`.
  `switchTo(id)` completes after the new theme is active, keeps the current theme on screen while it loads and when
  it fails, throws `StratumThemeNotFoundException` for an unknown id, and lets the latest of overlapping switches
  win. For the active id it does nothing, unless a newer install of that id is registered and not yet on screen:
  then it shows that install, with no `onThemeChanged`. The package stores nothing: save the id `onThemeChanged`
  reports.
- **`StratumThemeApplication.controlled`** — `StratumThemeApplication.controlled(controller:, themeMode:,
  highContrast:, componentDefaults:, child:)` publishes the controller's active theme and rebuilds dependents once
  per switch; below it, `StratumThemeController.of(context)` and `maybeOf(context)` find the controller, so a theme
  picker calls `StratumThemeController.of(context).switchTo('brand')`. `StratumThemeApplication(themes:)` stays for a
  fixed theme set.
- **`StratumThemePreloader`** — the widget form of `preload`: `StratumThemePreloader(initialThemeId:,
  onThemeChanged:, googleFontsTimeout:, loading:, error:, builder: (context, controller) => ...)` shows `loading`
  until the start theme is active, then `builder`, or `error` with what preload threw; it reads its asset bundle from
  `DefaultAssetBundle` and disposes its controller when it leaves the tree. Pick it or `await preload(...)` before
  `runApp`, not both.
- **Remote theme zips** — hand a downloaded `<id>.zip` with the checksum your own API serves (never a file beside the
  zip): `StratumRemoteTheme(id:, bytes:, checksum: 'sha256:<64 hex>')`, caps `maxBytes` 20 MB and `maxEntries` 200 by
  default. Pass kept zips to `preload(remoteThemes: [...], onRemoteThemeError: (id, error) => ...)` or the same two
  parameters of `StratumThemePreloader`; a zip that fails is skipped and reported, so delete it and download it again.
  At run time `await controller.install(theme)`, then `switchTo(theme.id)`; installing the active id repaints in one
  step with no `onThemeChanged`. The latest install of an id that reaches registration wins, a bundled id too, for the
  run only; of overlapping `install` calls for one id, the later-started call that installs wins, and an earlier call
  that finishes after it completes normally while installing nothing, so await the call you started last; a later call
  that fails leaves an earlier one free to install. `default` is always refused. Ask your server for the zip of
  `StratumSchemaVersion.current`. `theme.yaml` sits at the zip root or in its one top folder; every `files:` font and
  asset slot it names must be in the zip; `Google/<Name>` fonts load as for a bundled theme. A failure throws
  `StratumRemoteThemeException` with a `code` (`StratumRemoteThemeErrorCode`), `themeFormat` carrying the FO-01 report
  in `formatException`. Its `path` field is entry text straight from the zip: escape it before your app logs or shows
  it, since a hostile zip crafts it. `StratumThemeFormatException` and each `StratumThemeFormatError` print their
  yaml paths and messages escaped, but an error's `path` field is the raw yaml path: escape it the same way.
- **Pack and check a theme zip** — from your app project, `dart run stratum_ui:stratum_theme pack <folder>` writes
  `<id>.zip` (the id is the folder name, or `--id`; `--out <folder>` to write elsewhere) and prints `sha256:<hex>`, the
  checksum your API serves; the same folder always packs to the same bytes. `dart run stratum_ui:stratum_theme check
  <file.zip>` runs your app's own install checks on a zip, over the package default and your
  `assets/themes/default/theme.yaml` when you have one (`--app-default <path>` for another file); pass `--max-bytes` and
  `--max-entries` when your app raises a cap. A run that passes prints only the checksum on stdout; stderr names the
  defaults read, each problem with the code your app would report, and `warning:` lines (files the theme does not name,
  names that differ only in letter case) that never fail it. Exit 0 pass, 1 check failed, 64 usage, 66 a missing
  folder, zip file, or `--app-default` file, an `--out` that is not a folder, or a zip that fails to write. Names
  starting with `.` and `__MACOSX/` stay out; a symbolic link or other special entry fails the pack. stratum_ui allows
  only the google_fonts version its CLI family list came from, so the CLI and your app accept the same `Google/<Name>`
  families.
