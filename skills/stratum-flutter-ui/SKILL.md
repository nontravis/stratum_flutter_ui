# Stratum Flutter UI

Every screen and component in an app that depends on `stratum_ui` builds on this layout family. Each primitive styles
its own box (`style: WidgetStyle`), takes one interaction (`interaction: StratumInteraction`) for taps, hover, and
shortcuts, and scrolls through one `scroll: StratumScroll` model — never a raw `Container`, `Column`, `Row`, or
`ListView`. Import the barrel: `package:stratum_ui/src/src.dart`.

## Box layouts

Each entry: usage, key parameters, keyboard behavior.

- **`ContainerLayout`** — a styled box around one `child`.
  Key parameters: `style`, `child`, `fit` (a `BoxFit` that scales `child` into the padded area through a
  `FittedBox`; asserts `fit == null || scroll == null`, because a scrolling box has no extent to fit into).
  Keyboard: none of its own; a tap surface comes from `interaction`.
- **`FlexLayout`** — the base of `ColumnLayout` and `RowLayout`: a `Flex` whose `direction` may change between
  builds without remounting children, with `mainAxisAlignment`, `crossAxisAlignment`, `gap` (maps to `Flex.spacing`),
  and `crossAxisIntrinsic` (sizes the cross axis to the largest child, unless `style` sets that cross size; a
  `direction` change keeps the children's `State` with it set too, and only toggling it remounts them).
  Keyboard: `focusGroup` turns its children into one roving Tab stop (K3): arrows by screen direction, Home, End.
- **`ColumnLayout`**, **`RowLayout`** — `FlexLayout` with `direction` fixed to vertical or horizontal; same
  parameters, defaults, and order as before `FlexLayout` existed, so no caller changes.
  Keyboard: same `focusGroup` roving group as `FlexLayout`.
- **`StackLayout`** — a `Stack` for overlapping and `Positioned` children, with `alignment`, `fit`, and
  `clipBehavior` acting on the stack (`style.alignment`/`style.clipBehavior` act on the box instead).
  Keyboard: none; every child keeps its own focus.
- **`IndexedStackLayout`** — shows one child at `index` (null shows none) and mutes hidden children's tickers through
  `TickerMode`, so paused animations resume on return. Key parameters: `index`, `alignment`, `sizing`, `clipBehavior`.
  Keyboard: when `index` changes while focus sits in the outgoing child, focus moves after the frame to the first
  Tab-order node of the incoming child, else to the stack's own (non-Tab-stop) node.
- **`WrapLayout`** — a `Wrap` that lays children in runs across `direction`, with `gap`, `runGap`, and `focusGroup`.
  Keyboard: `focusGroup` roving group (K3), same as `FlexLayout`.

## Scroll views

All six share one keyboard model (K4) through the internal `ScrollViewBox`: a `focusable` view (true by default on
web, macOS, Windows, and Linux) is one Tab stop whose arrows (50 px), Page Up/Page Down (0.8 viewport), Home, and End
scroll it, guarded so a text field inside keeps its own keys.

- **`ListViewLayout`**, **`GridViewLayout`**, **`CustomScrollViewLayout`** — lazy list, grid, and sliver view inside
  a `WidgetStyle` box; `style.padding` becomes the scroll padding, so it scrolls with the content.
  Keyboard: K4 line-mode scrolling, each key over the theme's `fast` level (125 ms in the package default) on its
  `standard` curve, or a jump when `MediaQuery` or the platform asks for reduced motion.
- **`PageViewLayout`** (children or `.builder`) — one page per viewport, with `scrollDirection`, `controller`,
  `pageSnapping`, `onPageChanged`; `style.padding` insets the viewport rather than scrolling.
  Keyboard: an arrow along the axis, Page Up/Page Down, Home, and End move one whole page; a change slides over the
  theme's `slow` level (300 ms in the package default) on its `standard` curve, or jumps when `MediaQuery` or the
  platform asks for reduced motion or the level has no duration; focus moves to the new page's first Tab-order node.
  Buttons: the layout draws no previous or next buttons, and on desktop a mouse without a trackpad cannot swipe, so
  the app adds previous and next buttons around the view (WCAG 2.5.1) until a component in the package provides
  them. Like the keys, the buttons jump when motion is reduced: `jumpToPage` when
  `MediaQuery.disableAnimationsOf(context)` or the platform's `reduceMotion` is true, else `previousPage` or
  `nextPage` over 300 ms.

  ```dart
  void turn(BuildContext context, {required bool forward}) {
    final reduced =
        MediaQuery.disableAnimationsOf(context) ||
        View.of(context).platformDispatcher.accessibilityFeatures.reduceMotion;
    if (reduced) {
      final page = (pages.page ?? 0).round() + (forward ? 1 : -1);
      pages.jumpToPage(page.clamp(0, slides.length - 1));
    } else if (forward) {
      pages.nextPage(
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
        curve: Curves.easeInOutSine,
      );
    } else {
      pages.previousPage(
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
        curve: Curves.easeInOutSine,
      );
    }
  }

  ColumnLayout(
    children: [
      Expanded(child: PageViewLayout(controller: pages, children: slides)),
      RowLayout(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
        children: [
          ContainerLayout(
            semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Previous slide'),
            interaction: StratumInteraction(
              onTap: () => turn(context, forward: false),
            ),
            child: const Icon(Icons.chevron_left),
          ),
          ContainerLayout(
            semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Next slide'),
            interaction: StratumInteraction(
              onTap: () => turn(context, forward: true),
            ),
            child: const Icon(Icons.chevron_right),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  )
  ```
- **`ReorderableListViewLayout`** (`.builder` only) — a reorderable list on widgets `ReorderableList`, with a
  caller-placed drag handle or `longPressDrag`, `onReorderItem`, and `dragStyle` for the lifted item; each item keeps
  its `State` and focus across a move through a global key that never uses the index.
  Keyboard: Alt+arrow along the axis moves the focused item one slot, Alt+Home/Alt+End move it to either end; a move
  past either end is still handled, so it never reaches the browser (Chrome's Alt+Left/Alt+Right Back/Forward).
  Without dragging: dragging is the list's only pointer path, so the app adds one that needs no drag (WCAG 2.5.7),
  such as Move up and Move down buttons or context-menu entries on each item, until a component in the package
  provides it. They call the handler the app passes to `onReorderItem`, with the indexes the keys pass, and that
  handler ignores a target past either end.

  ```dart
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => RowLayout(
    key: ValueKey(tasks[index].id),
    children: [
      Expanded(child: Text(tasks[index].title)),
      ContainerLayout(
        semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Move up'),
        interaction: StratumInteraction(onTap: () => moveTask(index, index - 1)),
        child: const Icon(Icons.arrow_upward),
      ),
      ContainerLayout(
        semantics: const SemanticsProperties(button: true, label: 'Move down'),
        interaction: StratumInteraction(onTap: () => moveTask(index, index + 1)),
        child: const Icon(Icons.arrow_downward),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  ```
- **`NestedScrollViewLayout`** — a collapsing header (`headerSliverBuilder`) above a `body` scroll view; it is never
  a Tab stop itself, only the body's scroll view is, and a desktop scrollbar needs `showScrollbar: false` when the
  body is a `TabBarView`.
  Keyboard: the body's K4 keys act on one joined range, header extent then list extent — a key that would collapse
  past the header's end spills the remainder into the list, and Home/End expand or fully collapse the header.

## Spacing

- **`Space`** — static getters/constructors for fixed spacers and insets (`Space.box16`, `Space.empty`, and the
  rest), returning `SizedBox`, `Gap`, or `EdgeInsets` in steps from 1 to 72 px.
- **`SpaceDirectional`** — the same steps as `EdgeInsetsDirectional`, so start and end mirror under
  `TextDirection.rtl`.
